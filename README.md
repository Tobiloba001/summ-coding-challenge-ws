# SUMM full stack coding challenge (working student)

As the next step in our interview process, we'd like you to complete a small coding challenge.

## The project

You will build a small full stack app with Django and React.
The goal is to be able to use all CRUD operations in a simple webapp for the translation objects.<br>
A translation object is a simple object consisting of the attributes:

| Attribute  | Datatype |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Id         | Integer  |
| InputText  | String   |
| OutputText | String   |

You have to implement the following functions in the front and back end:

1. create a new translation object
2. update an existing translation
3. Read one translation object
4. Read all translation objects
5. Delete a translation object

There are no rules on how the front end should look like, be creative but keep it simple and user friendly

## Additional Information

- Here is a small tutorial of how to build a Django app: https://realpython.com/django-setup/
- Easiest use create-react-app for creating the React front end: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started
- using ORM for DB operations
- You can use all external libraries you find
- Have fun and do not overengineer it
- show us your skills in the commits that you have a clear structure in the code
- Reach out to me (Nicholas) if you have any questions

## How to submit

1. Fork this repository
2. Work on your solution (create meaningful commits; best to finish the project in one session so we can better review the commits)
3. (optional) Deploy the frontend and backend of your application using free services (Netlify, Heroku, etc).
4. Send me a link of your fork to submit

## Timeframe

You can complete the challenge until 13th of July. If you need more time, please reach out to us. You will not be judged on how quickly you complete the challenge.
